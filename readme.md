##Pluralize Test

A simple web app that pluralizes words using the [inflection](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inflection) npm module (which is used by sequelize) to determine how it will pluralize words.

This makes it easier to know how to name your tables/models in sequelize.

See it [live on heroku](http://plural-test.herokuapp.com/).
